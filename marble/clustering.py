    Assume that the class `c` is overrepresented in `N_u` areal units, and that

    Parameter
    ---------

    distribution: nested dictionaries
        Number of people per class, per areal unit as given in the raw data
        (ungrouped). The dictionary must have the following formatting:
        > {areal_id: {class_id: number}}

    areal_units: dictionnary
        Dictionnary of areal unit ids with shapely polygon object representing
        the unit's geometry as values.

    classes: dictionary of lists
        When the original categories need to be aggregated into different
        classes. 
        > {class: [categories belonging to this class]}
        This can be arbitrarily imposed, or computed with uncover_classes
        function of this package.

    Returns
    -------

    clustering: dictionary
        Dictionary of classes names with clustering values.
