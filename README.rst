<dl>
    <dt>Dissimilarity</dt>
    <dd>Compute the dissimilarity between different categories.</dd>
    <dt>Clustering</dt>
    <dd>Compute the level of geograhical clustering of the different

</dl>

Interaction
-----------
<dl>
    <dt>Exposure</dt>
    <dd>The extent to which two categories tend to live in the same areal units.
    This measure of exposure indicates whether the categories attract or repel one
    another.</dd>
    <dt>Emergent classes</dt> 
    <dd>Infer the class structure from the pattern of attraction/repulsion of
    the different categories</dd>

--------------
+ Areal units where the categories are over-represented
+ Obtain neighbourhoods by clustering areal units
